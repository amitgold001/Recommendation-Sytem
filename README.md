# Recommendation-Sytem
Advanced Recommender Systems with Python
Recommendation Systems usually rely on larger data sets and specifically need to be organized in a particular fashion. Because of this, we won't have a project to go along with this topic, instead we will have a more intensive walkthrough process on creating a recommendation system with Python with the same Movie Lens Data Set.
Review:

We have covered how to implement simple Collaborative Filtering methods, both memory-based CF and model-based CF.
Memory-based models are based on similarity between items or users, where we use cosine-similarity.
Model-based CF is based on matrix factorization where we use SVD to factorize the matrix.
Building recommender systems that perform well in cold-start scenarios (where little data is available on new users and items) remains a challenge. The standard collaborative filtering method performs poorly is such settings.
